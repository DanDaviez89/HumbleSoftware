# HumbleSoftware

I am going to be attemping to create the Humble software, Humble is a coffee shop/restraunt, they sell breakfasts/lunch sort of food and they also make coffee imported from one of their friends.

They wanted to implement new software so i took on the challenge.

The Problem:


-Select which table 1-12 
  (Can save orders in an array called orders, where you can add menuItems which will contain price and menuItemNames)
  
-Take in table orders
  (Create a menu system to allow user to add menuItems to Orders)
  
-Show price
  (Display menuItem.Price)
  
-Apply Discounts
  (Sum all the MenuItems.Price and dived by Discount%)
  
-Save the orders to the tables
  (Add a SaveMenuItems() function, where it will save all menuItems, which will be in a temp array to the Orders of which ever table they went into, which will then save it to the table.)
  
-Remove items from the table and show the price of the sum of the items getting removed, however keep the rest of the order on the tab till removed
  (Transfer over menuItems to another array and display the total price of all menuItems in that array, then allow to delete that array whilst still keeping the other array of menuItems)
  
-print out the order
  (Unsure how this is possible need to find out
